            We are Julius and Lola, two students based in WÃ¼rzburg. Last year
            we've decided to start a new hobby, which we believe everybody has
            inside their veins: travelling! So we've booked our first adventure
            besides from "holidays", to the beautifull islands of Norway -
            lofotens. Bevore beginning that trip, Julius bought a camera, and so
            the lust of travelling and exploring the world grew even further.

            On this blog, we want to share the spirit of travelling and
            showcasing our best photos we took while being around (as well as
            local).

            All started with an good old Sony Alpha 6000 camera and the well
            known kit-lens it comes with. With that setup we still captured some
            beautiful shots on lofoten (it's hard to shoot bad pictures there
            some need to say...), but over time, we wanted to have more
            professional gear - especially gear that you can also use on bad
            weather!

            Thus, our next iteration was the Fujifilm X-T3, which has shortly
            been replaced with it's successor, the X-T5.
